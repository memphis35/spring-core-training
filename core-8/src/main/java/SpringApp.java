// TODO
// 1. Copy all files from previous project.
// 2a. After V6Engine created and its cylinders injected, find a way to print a message
// based on this number - if it equals 6 -> "Engine is ready", otherwise "Engine is damaged"
// Before application shutdown, it should print "V6 engine is disassembled"
// 3. Whatever you did at step 2 and after VolkswagenBeetle created and its oil name injected,
// find ANOTHER way to print a message based on this name - "Beetle is filled with '$NAME' oil".
// Before application shutdown, it should print "Oil tank is empty"
// 4. Whatever you did at step 3 and after ChevroletCamaro created and its max speed injected, 
// find ANOTHER way to print a message based on this name - "$MAX_SPEED is my PB right now!".
// Before application shutdown, it should print "Chevrolet Camaro stopped moving"
